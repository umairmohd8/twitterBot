Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's-tongue, bull's-pizzle, you stock-fish!
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
Would thou wouldst burst!
The rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril
Poisonous bunch-backed toad!
Away, you three-inch fool!
I scorn you, scurvy companion
Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows
I'll beat thee, but I would infect my hands
I am sick when I do look on thee
Methink'st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee
You poor, base, rascally, cheating lack-linen mate!
